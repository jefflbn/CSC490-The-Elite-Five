# CSC490-The-Elite-Five
Our group name is The elite five and our project is the emotion detection. We collect 7 types of emotion of the images as training, valid and test from https://www.kaggle.com/code/hadeerismail/emotion-recognition#Data-Preprocessing.

Input: tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory() offers a convenient and efficient way to create TensorFlow datasets from image directories, automating tasks like resizing and batching while simplifying the integration of image data into machine learning workflows.

individual contributions: We will split the project in 5 parts, initial preprocessing, improved preprocessing,  optimization, model, and analysis. Ahmed Abdelaziz and Hashem AI Hussieny will focus on the initial preprocessing and improved preprocessing, Sahil will focus on the optimization, Haris Idrees will focus on the model, and Bonan lin will do the analysis portion and combine the poster.
