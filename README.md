## Project Name: Human Emotion Detection
## Collaborators: Ahmed Abdelaziz, Muhammad Haris Idrees, Hashem Al-Hussieny, Sahil Malek, Bonan Lin 

### The Problem
The problem we are solving is human facial emotion detection and identification. Given an image of a human face, we would like to classify the image with a human emotion. There are many real-world applications for this task. For example, emotion detection can be used in psychology to assist in understanding and aiding patients. It can also assist in any criminal interrogation and lie detection procedures. Finally, human emotion detection can enhance many social media applications, such as Snapchatâ€™s face filters.

### Dataset
The dataset is Emotion Detection (2020), provided by Kaggle. This dataset contains more than 35,000 human facial images of various emotion. The images themselves are 48x48 pixel grayscale images. There are 7 classes of emotions - happiness, neutral, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, fear.

### Running The Model
- Upload a zip of the dataset to your Google Drive account. Paste the path to the zip file into two locations marked with "TODO: Replace with path to dataset zip in your drive". This is to ensure that Google Colab can unzip the file into its file system. This is done to overcome the large overhead of directly reading files from Google Drive
